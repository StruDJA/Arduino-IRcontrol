# Arduino-IRcontrol 🎛️

## Introduction

This is the code for the project from [StruMAG's](https://strumag.tn/remote-control-your-appliance-part-1-infra-red?vref=github) post, Remote Control Your Appliance Part 1 Infra Red, it represents an entry point to start with if you're looking to control or play with [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) via Infra-Red.

You'll be adding Infra-Red to turn on/off your room light 💡️
